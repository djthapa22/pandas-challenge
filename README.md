# Pandas-Challnge: PyCitySchools

**Overview:**

In this assignmnet, I utilized the jupyternotebook, along with pandas module to create dataframe in analyzing school budget and student score data.
Within the excerise I learned how to do summarize the following criterias:

* District Summary
* School Summary
* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Math Scores by Grade
* Reading Scores by Grade
* Scores by School Spending
* Scores by School Size
* Scores by School Type

<ins> Conclusion: </ins>

Schools with small to mid-size student count, which can be indicative of smaller class sizes tend to perform better overall. 
This can become even more apparent as Charter schools perform better than district ones across the board. 
Additional information and data points need to be collected to verify if smaller class sizes, which would result in students receiving more guidance and attention by their instructors directly results in higher academic performance.
